# Exploration-and-analysis-of-Facebook-posts-on-ChatGPT.

# Usage
Run the main script to extract Facebook posts, preprocess the text, and generate insights. You can customize the parameters in the script to suit your needs.

python main_script.py
# Web Scraping and Data Extraction
The project uses Selenium for web scraping to extract Facebook posts. Ensure you have the ChromeDriver installed and set the correct path in the CHROME_DRIVER variable in the script.

# Text Preprocessing
Text preprocessing involves cleaning, removing stopwords, stemming, lemmatization, and eliminating noise from the extracted Facebook posts.

# Topic Modeling with LDA
The project utilizes the Gensim library for topic modeling using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). The number of topics and other parameters can be adjusted in the script.

# Word Cloud Generation
Word clouds are generated to visually represent the most significant words in the processed text. Separate word clouds can be created for each topic.

# Results and Analysis
The project provides insights into the topics discussed in the Facebook posts, helping users understand the prevalent themes.
